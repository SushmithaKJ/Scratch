### Overview
Tetration Analytics discovers application flows and dependencies and creates a policy. Application policies are then imported into AlgoSec BusinessFlow. Some use cases are:

- Map Firewall Rules to Business Applications 
- Tetration Analytics discovers application flows and dependencies. Application flows are matched with network security risks.
- The ServiceNow CMDB can be used to augment the inventory annotations in Tetration.Tetration Analytics generates whitelist policy recommendations. AlgoSec automatically pushes generated security policies to network security devices (firewalls, SDN, cloud)

The script helps you drive your business to a whitelist security model by ensuring your on-prem and cloud-based firewalls are enforcing the policy discovered by Tetration and tweaked by the application owner.
