### Overview
The Tetration add-on for Splunk Enterprise version 1.0 is available on Splunkbase. It requires middleware to interface with Tetration, and this integration acts as that middleware. The use cases are:

- Compliance & security on Splunk 
- Performance & fault info in Tetration
- Policy enforcement

The script will use Tetration APIs to retrieve ADM, endpoints, and inventory data and send them to the Tetration for Splunk add-in.
