### Overview
The vCenter annotations ecoScript will generate user annotations for your tetration deployment.  You can selectively annotate based on:

- VM Name
- VM Location
- VM Network
- vSphere Tags

The script will query tetration for any observed inventory endpoints and look for matching IPs or hostnames within your vCenter inventory.
