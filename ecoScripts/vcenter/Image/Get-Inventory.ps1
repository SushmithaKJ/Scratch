<#
.SYNOPSIS
Saves a full set of annotations obtained from vCenter as a CSV. If there is
already a saved file, the original file is overwritten and a diffs file  is
saved as well.

.DESCRIPTION
This script reads all of its parameters from OS environment variables. It
connects to vCenter and retrieves a complete list of VM annotations and
saves the annotations to /private. If there is a previously saved version,
the script does a diff and passes that off to another script to upload to
Tetration. If there is not a previously saved version, then the script
passes the entire list of annotations off.
