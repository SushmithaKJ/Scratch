"""
upload_annotations.py uploads an annotations CSV file to Tetration. The CSV
should be located in local storage.

Keyword environment variables:
--MULTITENANT: on/off to indicate if the file should be uploaded to a VRF
--TENANT_VRF: name of the VRF to which we upload the CSV; if not in multi-
    tenant mode, then this variable is ignored
--TETRATION_ENDPOINT: URL of the Tetration UI
--TETRATION_API_KEY: key for Tetration API access
--TETRATION_API_SECRET: secret for the above key
