### Overview
The Infoblox annotations ecoScript will generate user annotations for your tetration deployment.  You can selectively annotate based on:

- Hostname
- Subnet
- Zone
- Extensible Attributes

The script will query tetration for any observed inventory endpoints and look for matching IPs or hostnames within your Infoblox inventory.
