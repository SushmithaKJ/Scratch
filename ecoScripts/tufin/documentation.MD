### Overview
Tetration Analytics discovers application flows and dependencies and creates a policy. Application policies are then imported into Tufin. Some benefits:

- Visualize security policy based on network flow data 
- Discover application connectivity in complex, hybrid environments
- Measure application compliance with security policy
- Maintain service uptime while rapidly responding to business change

The script helps you drive your business to a whitelist security model by ensuring your on-prem and cloud-based firewalls are enforcing the policy discovered by Tetration and tweaked by the application owner.
